# 🎓 Student Performance Analyzer using Python, NumPy & Pandas

This project is a **Student Performance Analyzer** built using **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Pandas**.  
It helps in analyzing student marks, attendance, grades, toppers, weak students, and subject-wise performance.

This is a beginner-friendly project that covers important data analysis concepts used in Machine Learning preprocessing.
